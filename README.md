# Flask and mongo-datatables
A sample website that shows how to use mongo-datatables with Flask.

----


## Install

You can install with pip:

    pip install mongo-datatables


## DataTables static files

These are the packages I linked to from DataTables. Note that I have excluded the Editor from
this demo because you have to pay to use Editor.  If you go that route, you'll have to download
DataTables static files and plug them into your Flask app.
